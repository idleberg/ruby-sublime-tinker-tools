# sublime-scissors

A simple Ruby scripts that cuts up Sublime Text completions and creates snippets from the pieces. Snippets are stricter than standard completions, as you can only trigger a snippet after typing the correct prefix. They also have a higher priority over completions. One of the advantages of completions is, of course, that they are often easier to create, especially when copy&paste is involved. Using sublime-scissors, you can create completions and later convert them to snippets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/sublimetext-scissors.git`
2. Change directory `cd sublimetext-scissors.git`
3. Install Gems using [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) `bundle install`

## Usage

There are several configuration options available in the header of `scissors.rb` and the should be pretty self-explanatory.

* `$to_subfolder` writes snippets to a subfolder when set to `true`
* `$delete_completions` deletes the completion files after conversion
* `$trigger_replace` define rules to replace strings in `trigger` before using its name to create a file
* `$contents_replace` define rules to replace strings in `completion` before writing it to a snippet

Place your `sublime-completions` to the same directory as the Ruby script and run `./scissors.rb` or `ruby scissors.rb`.
